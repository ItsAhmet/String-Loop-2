Letters method	
Write a program that reads a string from the user and a letter.  Print out how many times that letter occurs in the string.

Word method

Write a program that asks the user of a word.  Print out the word as many times as there are letters, deleting the last letter each time.  For example:
		Computer
		Compute
		Comput
		Compu
	            Comp
		Com
		Co
		C

BINGO method
	
Write a program that allows the user to enter a word.  Print out the word as many times as there are letters in the word.  Each time replace one more letter at the beginning of the word with an underscore. (Like : There was a farmer who had a dog and Bingo was his name-o.)  If the inputted word was WORD the output would be:
		WORD
		_ ORD
		_ _ RD
		_ _ _ D
